# Example how to include Kaniko image build to workflow when runner running on managed container environment

As tested in [Hi-Fi/image-build-on-managed-app-services](https://github.com/Hi-Fi/image-build-on-managed-app-services), building of image is possible at managed container environments (in the example AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)).

Open issue still was left, how this kind of build could be included in GitHub Actions workflow. Some options considered:

- Include Kaniko to same image with runner; This partially works, but can create strange issues as Kaniko would be overwriting whole running container's filesystem
  - At least if there's step after image build, runner process fails as it's log file disappears
- Fake somehow the root directory in a way that Kaniko would think that it's working in root while actual directory is something else
  - Currently no option found that would work with the limited capabilities offered
- Trigger separate task from runner's task and follow execution of that.
  - Creates double costs for some time
